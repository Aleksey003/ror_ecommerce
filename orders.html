<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>

  The checkout process starts on the http://www.yoursite.com/shopping/cart_items page.
</p><p>
  Clicking the <strong>"checkout button"</strong> Starts the order process.  This action takes all the active
  cart_items in the "shopping_cart" state and saves them as order_items.  Each order
  item represents one AND ONLY ONE, I repeat ONLY ONE, item.  There is no quantity field.
  It is IMPOSSIBLE to have a quantity field and do returns correctly.  DO NOT CHANGE THIS!
</p><p>
  At this point the Order is in an "in_progress" state.  Immediately the user is asked to
  enter their credentials for security reasons (unless they logged in with 20 minutes).
  Now the user is in the checkout workflow.  The basic workflow is determined by the
  Shopping::BaseController.next_form(order) method.  During the checkout the user is directed
  to the Shopping::OrdersController.index method.  The Shopping::BaseController.next_form(order)
  method is called and the next form to show is redirected to unless they are on the last step.
</p><p>
  <ul>
    <li> First it makes sure the Creditcard number passes luhn validation/date validation.</li>
    <li> Second there is a call to the app to verify the price is correct.
     <small>(BTW: this could change because the user has multiple tabs open in the browser)</small></li>
    <li> Then a call is made to with Active Merchant to get a token to authorize the charge.  If all goes well the
     transaction will go through and the card is charged.</li>
  </ul>
</p><p>
  The order will now be in the 'paid' state.  Each order item will also be marked as "paid".
